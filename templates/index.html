            <p>This visualization shows how new phrases are classified as being attributed to either a caregiver or a child.</p>
            <p>
                The data comes from the CHILDES corpus (<a href="https://talkbank.org/childes/access/Eng-NA/StoopsMontag.html">StoopsMontag</a>), a collection of transcribed interactions between adults and children. The classifier was trained using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html">logistic regression</a> from the scikit-learn library.
            </p>
            <p>
                The classifier has some clear limitations, but certain patterns do emerge. Longer and more grammatically complete phrases are typically attributed to the caretaker, while shorter or grammatically incorrect phrases are more often associated with the child. For example, a phrase like “it go there” is likely predicted as coming from a child, whereas “it goes there” is attributed to the caretaker. A similar pattern appears with word choices such as “mommy” versus “mom.” You can try submitting your own utterances in the input above to see how the model classifies them.
